### Household & Life

#### Freezer Inventory via Photos
- **Source**: brandon.wang/2026/clawdbot
- **Platform**: Slack
- **Description**: Take photos of everything in chest freezer, OpenClaw parses items and quantities, updates Notion inventory, removes stocked items from grocery list

#### Recipe to Grocery List
- **Source**: brandon.wang/2026/clawdbot
- **Platform**: Slack
- **Description**: Screenshot a recipe, OpenClaw extracts ingredients into Apple Reminders grocery list. Dedupes and combines quantities ("2 carrots becomes 3")

### Booking & Forms

#### Resy/OpenTable with Calendar Intersection
- **Source**: brandon.wang/2026/clawdbot
- **Platform**: Slack + Browser
- **Description**: Log into Resy (including reading 2FA from texts), browse availability page-by-page, intersect with both partners' calendars, suggest options. Learns cancellation policies and adds deadlines to calendar events
- **Why interesting**: End-to-end: 2FA handling + browser automation + calendar API + iterative learning. Near single-shot preference calibration that "takes months with a human PA"

#### Dentist Appointment Booking
- **Source**: brandon.wang/2026/clawdbot
- **Platform**: Browser + Calendar
- **Description**: Knows when cleaning is due, logs into dentist portal, finds slot matching calendar + location proximity, confirms before booking

### Price Monitoring

#### Complex Hotel Price Alerts with Photo Review
- **Source**: brandon.wang/2026/clawdbot
- **Platform**: Multi
- **Description**: 30+ simultaneous price alerts. Hotels/Airbnbs with reasoning criteria like "pullout bed OK if not in same room as another bed." Actually reviews listing photos to verify room layout
- **Why interesting**: Goes beyond simple price tracking -- visual reasoning on listing photos, subjective criteria evaluation. Plans to try "room vibe" and "renovated vs dingy" criteria

---

### Remote Development

#### Full Site Rebuild from Bed
- **Source**: @davekiss on X
- **Platform**: Telegram
- **Description**: Migrated entire personal site from Notion to Astro, 18 posts, DNS moved to Cloudflare. All via Telegram while watching Netflix, never opened laptop
- **Why interesting**: Shows the "phone as development terminal" paradigm shift. Non-trivial migration (CMS change + DNS) done casually

---

### Business

#### One-Person Digital Agency
- **Source**: openclaw.com.au/use-cases
- **Platform**: Multi
- **Description**: Solo marketer uses OpenClaw as "Chief of Staff" -- daily SEO client checks (5 sites), email triage + draft responses, blog/meta content creation, Shopify management, overnight PRs
- **Why interesting**: Replaces a small team. "I wake up to completed work instead of a to-do list"

---

### Self-Evolving Workflows

#### Workflow Self-Documentation to Notion
- **Source**: brandon.wang/2026/clawdbot
- **Platform**: Notion
- **Description**: OpenClaw auto-writes human-readable descriptions of every workflow it creates/modifies into a Notion database with version control. Shows diffs of how each workflow evolved
- **Why interesting**: Meta-capability -- the AI documents its own learning. Provides visibility and auditability. "These are little things that take months or years to dial in with a human PA. With clawdbot, nearly single shot."

---

### Messaging

#### Never Forgetting Text Promises
- **Source**: brandon.wang/2026/clawdbot
- **Platform**: iMessage + Calendar
- **Description**: Scans texts every 15 min. Detects concrete promises ("I'll review this tomorrow"), creates calendar events. Detects meeting plan ingredients (time + place + confirmation), drafts calendar invites, creates holds to prevent double-booking
- **Why interesting**: Bridges the tooling gap between email (Superhuman-level features) and texting (wild west). Proactive commitment tracking
