## How to Use

When My Lord asks about use cases or wants inspiration:

1. Reference the catalog below and `findings/` directory for past discoveries
2. Search the web for fresh examples (Twitter/X, Reddit, Discord, blogs)
3. Save new findings to `findings/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with structured format
4. Git commit and push to `liaosvcaf/openclaw-skill-usecases`
